# My Money Manager
My Money Manager is a application used to manage your finances. It's a thick client application written using Java and the Swing framework. It will make rest calls to send data over the wire to be persisted and retrieved. I wrote this application to gain more experience with Swing and thick client applications as I'm maintaining two thick client applications for the company i'm currently employed by.
